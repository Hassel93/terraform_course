Practice01
Create your first terraform files. Create in this folder a subdirectory with name "Practice01".
Create then all files that we need for a first and minimal version that can be execute with terraform.
Use local for your backend (https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/local) 
and the path for your backend should be terraform.tfstate 

Practice02a
Now we start with azure and setup our azure subscriptions.
Look at subscriptions.txt and copy your subscription id.
Now install azure cli https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli
Login to our tenant az login --tenant aab86598-da5a-4ebc-aab1-7a630e2ad212 and login.
Change your Subscription that is set to your account. Command az account set -s {SubscriptionID}
Create all resources that we need for a state that is saved in azure.
Create a resource group in your subscription with name tf_state_{yourname}.
Create a storage account with name tfstateterraform{yourname}.
Create a blob storage container inside this storage account with name state.

Practice02
Create a new folder in your practice folder with name "Practice02"
Create a minimal version that can be execute with terraform and the 
backend azurerm (https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/azurerm)
Use your your created Resource Group, Storage Account and Container for your Backend Settings.
For the setting with name key use terraform.tfstate as its value

After you did this make the steps that you need to apply a first run
After your first apply look in your blob storage container. What did you see?

Practice03
Create a new folder in your practice folder with name "Practice03" and copy your files from Practice02 into it.
Integrate the azurerm provider to your provider.tf
Tip: What is the first step after change or integrate a provider ?

Practice04
Create a new folder in your practice folder with name "Practice04" and copy your files from Practice03 into it.
Create a resource group with the name "terraformcourse" in your subscription. Location should be "switzerlandnorth"
Apply your new files and execute your changes. Check if your ressource group is available in your subscription.

Practice05
Create a new folder in your practice folder with name "Practice05" and copy your files from Practice04 into it.

If it is available, comment out (Set a # at the start of a line) everything in the file and execute your files again. 
Everything in your subscription should be deleted except the state resources. 
If you will you can remove the comments and see the magic of terraform.

Create a User in our AzureAD. Use the azuread provider for the user creation and the random provider to generate a password
The name of the user should be {yourname}user. The service principal name should be user_principal_name = "{yourname}user.@snfterraformcourse.onmicrosoft.com"
How you start ?

Create a ressource group with your own subscription azurerm provider. The name should be "manual_test_rg. Location should be switzerlandnorth.
Create a second ressource group with the second subscription azurerm provider. The name should be "manual_test_rg_yourname ". Location should be switzerlandnorth.
